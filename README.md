# Bee disease data collection, processing and detection
Bee health management - AI project topic

# Abstract
On the honeybee data collecting and processing task, there are many failures due to beekeeping farmersâ€™ non-cooperation (dislikes profit-making companies). This leads to difficulties in identifying and processing honey bee data such as mixing poor quality samples or not being able to detect diseases in bees. From the above needs, this project develops a system applying artificial intelligence combined with deep learning techniques for the identification of honey bee diseases based on images of bees or honeycombs.
